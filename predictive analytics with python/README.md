# Predictive Analytics with Python – Machine Learning Exercises #

In this project, I worked with several small datasets to practice basic machine learning methods.
I used a synthetic housing dataset for regression tasks, the well-known Iris dataset for clustering, and an income dataset for simple group analysis. My goal was to learn how different models behave with different types of data. For the regression part, I built simple and multiple linear regression models to predict housing prices. The results showed that the size of the house had the strongest effect on the final price. For classification, I tested k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines. After comparing them, SVM gave better accuracy on the sample data. For clustering, I used K-Means. On the Iris dataset, it formed three clear groups that matched the natural classes of the flowers. On the income data, it separated people into meaningful income-based groups.
Overall, this project helped me understand how to prepare data, train basic models, check their performance, and interpret the results in a practical way.
